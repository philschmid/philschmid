# Machine Learning Engineer & Cloud Enthusiast

Hello, my name is Philipp. I am 25 years old living in Nuremberg, Germany.

Currently I am working as a machine learning engineer and tech lead at Hugging Face to democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.. 

I am leading our collaboration and partnership with AWS and I am the Tech Lead for our new Inference Solution 🤗 Infinity.

In the past I designed and implemented cloud-native machine learning architectures for fin-tech and insurance companies.

In June 2021 I became the first German [AWS ML Hero](https://aws.amazon.com/de/developer/community/heroes/philipp-schmid/) 🦸🏻‍♂️

I found my passion for cloud concepts and machine learning 5 years ago. Since then I never stopped learning. Currently, I am focusing myself in the area NLP and how to leverage models like BERT, Roberta and GPT2 to generate business value.

I write about all the stuff i am working under [philschmid.de](https://www.philschmid.de) and you can finde me on twitter under @[_philschmid.de](https://twitter.com/_philschmid)
