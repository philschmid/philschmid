# Machine Learning Engineer & Cloud Enthusiast

Hello, my name is Philipp. I am 24 years old living in Nuremberg, Germany.

Currently I am working as a machine learning engineer and tech lead at Hugging Face to democratize artificial intelligence through open source and open science.. 

In the past I designed and implemented cloud-native machine learning architectures for fin-tech and insurance companies. 

I found my passion for cloud concepts and machine learning 3 years ago. Since then I never stopped learning. Currently, I am focusing myself in the area NLP and how to leverage models like BERT, Roberta and GPT2 to generate business value.

I love to design solution oriented, scalable, efficient architectures to solve real business problems. I believe that machine learning can support any company in any area at any time.

I write about all the stuff i am working under [philschmid.de](https://www.philschmid.de) and you can finde me on twitter under @[_philschmid.de](https://twitter.com/_philschmid)
