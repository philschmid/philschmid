## Hi there 👋

Hello, my name is Philipp. I am 24 years old living in Nuremberg, Germany.

 I have a blog [philschmid.de](https://www.philschmid.de).

Currently I am working as a machine learning engineer at technology incubation start up. 

At work design and implement cloud-native machine learning architectures for fin-tech and insurance companies. 

I found my passion for cloud concepts and machine learning 3 years ago. Since then I never stopped learning. Currently, I am focusing myself in the area NLP and how to leverage models like BERT, Roberta and GPT2 to generate business value.

I love to design solution oriented, scalable, efficient architectures to solve real business problems. I believe that machine learning can support any company in any area at any time.

You can find me on twitter under @[_philschmid.de](https://twitter.com/_philschmid)

## ⚡Technologies 

I believe that one should not have a fixed technology stack, but should always respond to the needs and problems of the customer. Below is just an excerpt and my favorite technologies in machine learning, cloud and non-ML frameworks.

**🤖 Machine Learning**  
Pytorch, Pytorch-lightning, Huggingface Transformers, PyCaret, Scikit-Learn, Tensorflow, Weights & Bias, Optuna, Pandas, Numpy

**☁️ Cloud**  
AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, Kubeflow, Docker, Terraform, Github Actions, Serverless Framework

**🏗️ Non-ML Frameworks**  
React, Vue, React-Native, LitElement, GraphQL, Gatsby, TailwindCSS
