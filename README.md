### Hello, my name is Philipp

I am a Senior AI Relation Engineer at Google DeepMind, where I'm building the first AI DevRel team to bring Google DeepMind's AI research to every developer. 

My mission is to help every developer to build with AI responsibly, ethically, and successfully, leveraging everything from open models to foundation models like Gemini and Gemma, across cloud and on-device platforms. 

Before joining Google DeepMind in 2025, I was a Technical Lead at Hugging Face, leading strategic collaborations and partnerships with major cloud providers [AWS](https://huggingface.co/blog/aws-partnership), [Google Cloud](https://huggingface.co/blog/gcp-partnership), [Azure](https://huggingface.co/blog/hugging-face-endpoints-on-azure), Cloudflare, Digial Ocean, Dell...). 

At Hugging Face, I was instrumental in growing our revenue [from $0 to ~$100 million in 4 years through our cloud and hardware offerings]((https://sacra.com/c/hugging-face/)). I served as the Technical/Engineering Lead for key partnerships, creating solutions like Hugging Face Inference Endpoints to simplify LLM deployment. My focus has consistently been on making advanced AI, particularly LLMs and RLHF, accessible and practical for real-world applications.

Beyond deployment, I collaborated with Hugging Face's open-source and science teams to improve LLM accessibility and focused on leveraging RLHF for enterprise and business use cases, including Zephyr, SmolLM, StarCoder and more.

My passion for cloud computing and AI began over 10 years ago. I've designed and implemented multiple cloud-native AI architectures for various industries and was recognized as the first German AWS Machine Learning Hero in 2021. I actively share my knowledge through research, blog posts, and on [LinkedIn](https://twitter.com/_philschmid), and [X (formerly Twitter)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipp-schmid-a6a2bb196/).

On my blog [philschmid.de](https://www.philschmid.de), I break down complex AI concepts, share practical tutorials, and provide insights into the latest advancements in the field, a practice I continue to this day.
